Your help is valuable since this is a hobby project for all of us: we do development during out-of-office hours.

### Usage 
- Install with the Wizard
- Goto "C:\Program Files\neXn-Systems\nxn-AutoExtractService"
- Edit config.nxn with your favorite texteditor
- Change "operatingPath" to something like "operatingPath=C:\Users\username\Downloads\AutoExtract"
- Restart the service (winkey+r, services.msc, nxn-AutoExtractService, restart)

### ToDo
- InnoSetup, set operating directory at setup
